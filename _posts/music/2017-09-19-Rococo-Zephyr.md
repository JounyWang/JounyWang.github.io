She lay beside me like a
她躺在我的旁边
branch from a tender willow tree
就像一根纤柳树上伸出来的枝干
I was as still as still as a
我可以一直一直像那
river could be
河流一样安详
When a rococo zephyr
当徐徐清风
swept over her and me
轻轻吹动她的秀发和我的衣衫

She watched the water
她静静地看着水面
ripple ripple ripple ripple light
波纹荡啊荡啊漂向远方
Light watched the water
阳光洒下让水面熠熠生辉
ripple ripple ripple ripple she
她情不自禁的随之轻轻摆动起了身体
I did some kind of dance
我快乐的跳起了舞
jaunty as a bee
活泼的就像个乐陶陶的小蜜蜂
I tried to look my best
什么东西一闪而过，我想把它看得更清楚
a finch in wild mint vest
哦，原来是一只来野薄荷丛里觅食的小雀儿
A fiercer force had wrenched
她用老大的力气把我到处张望的身体拧了过来
her from where she used to be
她还在原来她躺的地方我却没有陪着她
I caught and caressed the length of her
我抱住她并且爱抚她的身体
a tender willow branch floating on me
让她趴到我身上，从头到脚地爱抚这个仿佛纤柳树枝条的美人儿

Well maybe this was all was all meant to be
哦也许这一切都是在提醒我
Maybe this is all is all that meant to be
哦也许这一切都是在提醒我，爱她才是我要做的
A rococo zephyr crept up
微风徐来
and stepped over her and me
轻抚着她及我
Well I used to be sort of blind
哦我从未见过比她更美的风景
Now I can sort of see
她让我深深的沉醉
