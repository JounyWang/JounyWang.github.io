She lay beside me like a branch from a tender willow tree

她躺在我的旁边 就像一根纤柳树上伸出来的枝干

I was as still as still as a river could be

我可以一直一直像那河流一样安详

When a rococo zephyr swept over her and me

当徐徐清风轻轻吹动她的秀发和我的衣衫

She watched the water ripple ripple ripple ripple light

她静静地看着水面波纹 荡啊荡啊漂向远方

Light watched the water ripple ripple ripple ripple she

阳光洒下让水面熠熠生辉 她情不自禁的随之轻轻摆动起了身体

I did some kind of dance jaunty as a bee

我快乐的跳起了舞 活泼的就像个乐陶陶的小蜜蜂

I tried to look my best a finch in wild mint vest

什么东西一闪而过，我想把它看得更清楚

A fiercer force had wrenched her from where she used to be

哦，原来是一只来野薄荷丛里觅食的小雀儿 她用老大的力气把我到处张望的身体拧了过来 她还在原来她躺的地方我却没有陪着她

I caught and caressed the length of her a tender willow branch floating on me

我抱住她并且爱抚她的身体 让她趴到我身上，从头到脚地爱抚这个仿佛纤柳树枝条的美人儿

Well maybe this was all was all meant to be

哦也许这一切都是在提醒我

Maybe this is all is all that meant to be

哦也许这一切都是在提醒我，爱她才是我要做的

A rococo zephyr crept up and stepped over her and me

微风徐来轻抚着她及我

Well I used to be sort of blind

哦我从未见过比她更美的风景

Now I can sort of see

她让我深深的沉醉
