[Diamonds And Rust - Joan Baez](https://music.163.com/#/song?id=18855067)

Well I'll be damned
噢，我真该死
Here comes your ghost again
你的幻影又再出现
But that's not unusual
但那并非不寻常
It's just that the moon is full
只因在这满月时分
And you happened to call
你恰巧打电话过来
And here I sit
而我坐在这儿
Hand on the telephone
手持电话
Hearing a voice I'd known
听着遥远记忆里
A couple of light years ago
熟悉的声音
Heading straight for a fall
直坠入深渊之中
As I remember your eyes
我记得你的双眼
Were bluer than robin's eggs
比知更鸟蛋的颜色更蓝
My poetry was lousy you said
你说我写的诗糟透了
Where are you calling from?
“你从哪里打电话来？”
A booth in the midwest
“中西部的某个电话亭”
Ten years ago
十年前
I bought you some cufflinks
我买过一些袖口扣给你
You brought me something
你也送给我一些东西
We both know what memories can bring
我们都知道回忆能带来些什么
They bring diamonds and rust
它们带来了钻石与铁锈
Well you burst on the scene
噢，当年你突然而至
Already a legend
已是奇迹
The unwashed phenomenon
未受关注的奇迹
The original vagabond
你最初漂泊流浪
You strayed into my arms
泊入了我的臂弯
And there you stayed
在那里，你短暂停留
Temporarily lost at sea
只因迷航海上
The Madonna was yours for free
圣母玛利亚无偿眷顾你
Yes the girl on the half-shell
是的，单片贝壳上的爱神维纳斯
Could keep you unharmed
当年能保护你免受伤害
Now I see you standing
此刻，我看到你伫立在
With brown leaves falling around
纷飞的褐色落叶中
And snow in your hair
雪落发梢
Now you're smiling out the window
此刻，你就在那间破旧旅馆窗前
Of that crummy hotel
对着下面的华盛顿广场微笑
Over Washington Square

Our breath.es out white clouds
我们彼此呼出的气息如云雾般交错，
Mingles and hangs in the air
凝结在空气中
Speaking strictly for me
对于我，严格来说
We both could have died then and there
当时的场景足以令我们死而无憾
Now you're telling me
如今，你对我说
You're not nostalgic
你并不念旧
Then give me another word for it
那么请用另一个词来代替
You who are so good with words
你向来擅于措辞，
And at keeping things vague
擅于把事情模糊化
Because I need some of that vagueness now
因为此刻我正需要那种模糊
It's all.e back too clearly
过去的一切都太清晰地呈现
Yes I loved you dearly
是的，我曾深爱着你
And if you're offering me diamonds and rust
而倘若你还想带给我钻石与铁锈
I've already paid
那么，我已经为此付出过代价了
