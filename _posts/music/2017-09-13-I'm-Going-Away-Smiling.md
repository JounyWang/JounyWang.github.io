I'm going away just smiling

thinking about of life

how we were good for each other

and how we knew

when I came to you

I was all black and blue

You just smiled and said

your love was true

we had a great time, didn't we?

never knew this is how it would be...

now the boat is slowly leaving

leaving the life I loved

I see you standing at the pier

trying to hide your fear

thank you for the memories

thank you for the laughs

I'm going away, this time

remember... no tears
