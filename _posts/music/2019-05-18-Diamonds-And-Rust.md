[Diamonds And Rust - Joan Baez](https://music.163.com/#/song?id=18855067)

Well, I'll be damned 

Here comes your ghost again 

But that's not unusual 

It's just that the moon is full 

And you happened to call 

And here I sit 

Hand on the telephone 

Hearing a voice I'd known 

A couple of light years ago 

Heading straight for a fall

As I remember your eyes 

Were bluer than robin's eggs 

My poetry was lousy you said 

Where are you calling from? 

A booth in the midwest 

Ten years ago 

I bought you some cufflinks 

You brought me something 

We both know what memories can bring 

They bring diamonds and rust

Well, you burst on the scene 

Already a legend 

The unwashed phenomenon 

The original vagabond 

You strayed into my arms 

And there you stayed 

Temporarily lost at sea 

The Madonna was yours for free 

Yes, the girl on the half-shell 

Could keepâ€¦
